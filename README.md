<h1>NANO Website Conventions</h1>
<h2>TAPPI Developers MUST Read!!!</h2>
<p>This is a guide to the standards and conventions used in the design of this website. Please adhere to the rules so yourself and future developers don't lose their minds.</p> 

<h3>About</h3>
<p>This project is based on the <a href="https://github.com/leemunroe/motherplate" target="_blank">Motherplate Responsive Boilerplate</a>. This is a great tool for setting up a development environment, and will be customized to match TAPPI's needs as the redevelopment of our hosted microsites progresses. It is based on SASS (.scss) and is compiled using Compass. Both of these technologies are dependent on Ruby -- so that must be installed on the development machine. Specific instructions for setting up a basic workflow using the aforementioned technologies in conjunction with Git version control will be posted soon.</p>

<p>It is important that TAPPI developers read the documentation here to ensure a complete understanding of the conventions and standards used in creating the websites. We will go through each SASS file to understand the purpose of each</p>

<h2>SCSS File Examination</h2>

<h3>_config.scss</h3>
<p>This should be your first stop. The config stylesheet creates a shorthand for the font-sizes, color-schemes, and basic page behaviors that ensure a consistent viewing experience. Please go through and fimiliarize yourself with the base settings, and edit them as needed for the project you are working on.<p>
